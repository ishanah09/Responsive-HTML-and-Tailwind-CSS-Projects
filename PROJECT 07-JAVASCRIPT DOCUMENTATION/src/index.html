            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment
            (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the
            objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over
            them.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6 ml-4 leading-relaxed">
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array,
            Date, and Math, and a core set of language elements such as
            operators, control structures, and statements. Core JavaScript can
            be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with
            additional objects; for example:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li class="mb-3 ml-8 list-disc">
              Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
              For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place
              elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse
              clicks, form input, and page navigation.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-3 ml-8 list-disc">
              Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying
              objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server. For example,
              server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a
              database, provide continuity of information from one invocation to
              another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a
              server.

            JavaScript and Java are similar in some ways but fundamentally
            different in some others. The JavaScript language resembles Java but
            does not have Java's static typing and strong type checking.
            JavaScript follows most Java expression syntax, naming conventions
            and basic control-flow constructs which was the reason why it was
            renamed from LiveScript to JavaScript.
          </p>

          <p class="mb-6 ml-4 leading-relaxed">
            In contrast to Java's compile-time system of classes built by
            declarations, JavaScript supports a runtime system based on a small
            number of data types representing numeric, Boolean, and string
            values. JavaScript has a prototype-based object model instead of the
            more common class-based object model. The prototype-based model
            provides dynamic inheritance; that is, what is inherited can vary
            for individual objects. JavaScript also supports functions without
            any special declarative requirements. Functions can be properties of
            objects, executing as loosely typed methods.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6 ml-4 leading-relaxed">
            JavaScript is a very free-form language compared to Java. You do not
            have to declare all variables, classes, and methods. You do not have
            to be concerned with whether methods are public, private, or
            protected, and you do not have to implement interfaces. Variables,
            parameters, and function return types are not explicitly typed.

            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application.
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain
            rules.
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6 ml-4 leading-relaxed">
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), or
            dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9).
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters
            "A" through "Z" (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z"
            (lowercase).
          </p>
          <p class="mb-6 ml-4 leading-relaxed">
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in
            identifiers. You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as
            characters in identifiers. Some examples of legal names are
            Number_hits, temp99, and _name.
